# Assignment

The goal of this assignment is to create a web application using Django that implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. 

## Project Requirements

1. Create a Django project from scratch or use an existing one.

2. Create at least one Django app to handle the CRUD functionality.

3. Create a model for your data. This model should include fields for the data you want to store.

4. Create a view for each of the CRUD operations.

5. Use templates to render the views and display the data.

6. Create forms to handle the input of data.

7. Implement validation to ensure that the data entered is correct.

8. Implement user authentication and authorization to ensure that only authorized users can perform CRUD operations.

## Project Steps

1. Create a new Django project using the `django-admin startproject` command.

2. Create a new Django app using the `python manage.py startapp` command.

3. Define your model in the app's `models.py` file. You can use Django's built-in fields or create custom fields. 

4. Create a view to handle the creation of new data. In this view, create a form using Django's built-in forms or create custom forms.

5. Create a view to handle the retrieval of data. This view should display a list of all the data entries in the database.

6. Create a view to handle the updating of data. In this view, create a form to allow users to update an existing data entry.

7. Create a view to handle the deletion of data. This view should prompt the user to confirm the deletion before deleting the data.

8. Create templates for each view using HTML, CSS, and Django's templating language.

9. Implement validation for your forms to ensure that the data entered is correct. You can use Django's built-in validators or create custom validators.

10. Implement user authentication and authorization using Django's built-in authentication system or a third-party library like Django-Allauth.

## Submission Requirements

1. Submit the source code of your project along with any necessary configuration files.

2. Include a README file that provides instructions on how to run the project and any dependencies.

3. Provide screenshots or a video demo of your project in action, showcasing each of the CRUD operations.

4. Clearly document any assumptions or limitations in your implementation.

## Conclusion

By completing this assignment, you will have gained a practical understanding of how to create a web application using Django that implements CRUD functionality. This will help you in developing more complex web applications in the future. Good luck!
