# Django Concept

Django is a web framework for building web applications in Python. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, where the Model represents the application's data and logic, the View is responsible for rendering the user interface, and the Controller handles user input and coordinates communication between the Model and View. 

## Topic

| Django Concept             | Description                                                                                       |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. [Django Project](./1-project.md)         | A collection of settings, URLs, and apps that defines the functionality of a Django web application. |
| 2. Django Commands         | Command-line tools that facilitate various tasks in a Django project, such as running the server, running tests, and creating database tables. |
| 3. View function           | A Python function that takes an HTTP request and returns an HTTP response. It determines the content that is displayed to a user in a web application. |
| 4. Django Model            | A Python class that represents a database table and its fields. It is used to define the schema of a database in a Django project. |
| 5. Django ORM              | An object-relational mapping (ORM) tool that maps Python objects to database tables and vice versa. It allows developers to interact with a database using Python code. |
| 6. CRUD                    | An acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, the four basic functions of persistent storage. In Django, these operations are typically performed using the Model class and ORM. |
| 7. Django Admin Panel      | A built-in application that provides a web-based interface for managing a Django project's data. It allows administrators to view, create, edit, and delete objects in the database. |
| 8. Authentication and Authorization | Two related processes that control access to a Django project. Authentication involves verifying the identity of a user, while authorization involves determining what actions that user is allowed to perform. |
| 9. Static Files            | Files that are served directly to users by a web server, such as images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files. In Django, these files are typically stored in a project's "static" directory. |
| 10. Create Website using Django | The process of building a web application using the Django web framework. This typically involves creating a Django project, defining models and views, creating templates, and configuring the project's URLs. |
| 11. Key Features           | A list of features that make Django a popular choice for web development, including its built-in ORM, template engine, administration interface, and support for third-party packages. |
