# Authentication and authorization

Authentication and authorization are important aspects of building secure web applications, and Django provides built-in features to handle these tasks.

Authentication refers to the process of verifying the identity of a user who is trying to access a protected resource, such as a web page or an API endpoint. Django provides a powerful and flexible authentication system that allows you to authenticate users using a variety of methods, such as username and password, social media logins, or single sign-on (SSO).

Django's authentication system is based on the concept of a User model, which represents a user of your application. The User model includes fields for storing basic user information, such as username, email, and password, and it provides methods for authenticating users and managing their permissions.

To enable authentication in your Django application, you need to configure the authentication backend and define the login and logout views. Django provides several authentication backends out of the box, such as the default database backend and third-party backends for social media authentication. You can also create your own custom authentication backends if needed.

Authorization refers to the process of determining what actions a user is allowed to perform on a resource based on their role or permissions. Django provides a flexible and granular authorization system that allows you to define permissions at the model, view, and template level.

Django's authorization system is based on the concept of a Permission model, which represents a specific permission that can be granted to a user or group of users. Permissions can be associated with a model or a view, and they can be assigned to users or groups using the Django admin interface or programmatically.

To enable authorization in your Django application, you need to define the permissions for your models and views, and check the user's permissions in your views and templates. Django provides several tools for handling permissions, such as the `login_required` decorator, the `permission_required` decorator, and the `user_passes_test` decorator.

Overall, Django's authentication and authorization systems provide a powerful and flexible way to build secure web applications that protect user data and resources. By using these features, you can ensure that only authorized users can access your application's sensitive data and functionality.
