# Install Django

Install pip
To install pip on your computer, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.

2. Run the following command to download the `get-pip.py` script:

   ```python
   curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
   ```

3. Once the download is complete, run the following command to install pip:
   ```python
   python3 get-pip.py
   ```

4. Wait for the installation to complete. Once the installation is finished, pip should be installed on your computer.

5. You can verify that pip is installed by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the following command:
   ```python
   pip --version
   ```

   This should display the version of pip you have installed on your computer.

> Note: If you are using a version of Python earlier than Python 3.4, pip may not be included with your Python installation. In this case, you can download the `get-pip.py` script and run it using your Python interpreter (e.g. `python get-pip.py` for Python 2).
